    "Not strictly necessary; Pandas is convenient for moderate-sized data with its simple rolling().mean(). Alternatives like NumPy or raw Python work but are less intuitive. Conversion to Pandas is justified if youâ€™re already using its ecosystem or need its time-series features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would Dask be better? Why?\n",
    "Dask is better for large datasets (>1GB) or distributed computing, as it handles out-of-memory data and parallelizes tasks. For smaller datasets or single-machine workflows, Pandas is faster and simpler. Use Dask only if memory or scaling needs arise."
